# Data Structures
The idea behind this repository is to be a centralized space in which I can improve upon my JavaScript and Data Structures/Algorithm skills. Inspiration stems from the following: 
UW: CSE 142, Computer Programming I
UW: CSE 143, Computer Programming II
UW: CSE 332, Data Structures and Parallelism 
UW: CSE 421, Introduction to Algorithms
