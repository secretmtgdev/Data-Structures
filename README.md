# Data Structures
The idea behind this repository is to be a centralized space in which I can improve upon my JavaScript and Data Structures/Algorithm skills. Inspiration stems from the following: 
- UW: CSE 142, Computer Programming I
- UW: CSE 143, Computer Programming II
- UW: CSE 332, Data Structures and Parallelism 
- UW: CSE 421, Introduction to Algorithms
- Amazon 
- Geeksforgeeks 
- Techsith
- MDN
- W3

1/20        Network flows
</pre>

#### Note   
DUE TO CORS YOU MUST HAVE A SERVER INSTANCE RUNNING!
fix: run _npm install static-server -g_ to install a simple server, type in _static server_ into the correct directory, and open up _localhost:9080_

Along the way the following are also to be covered as I grow and develop:
1. JavaScript
  a. Prototypical Inheritance 
  b. Classes
  c. Closure 
  d. This keyword
  e. Data types
2. OOP
  a. Inheritance 
  b. Polymorphism 
  c. Encapsulation 
  d. Abstraction
